														<h3 class="major">Goals</h3>
														<p>
															<b>Goal 1: Enhance My UI/UX Design Skills</b>
															<p>During my co-op term at Entact Solutions, I had a valuable opportunity to enhance my UI/UX design skills. I worked directly on the layout and design of the HOS application and website, which allowed me to apply various accessibility principles and focus on user-friendly interfaces. I enhanced my hands-on experience at Entact Solutions by reading various UI/UX blogs and exploring Figma tutorials provided to me by the team. I also gathered feedback from my team on multiple variations and versions of my designs and used that input to improve functionality and aesthetics. One of my proudest moments was implementing simple and easy-to-follow navigation in the HOS application, which improved usability and received positive feedback from the team I was working with. Conducting informal user testing gave me experience and insights regarding user behaviour which allowed me to make decisions that better aligned with real user needs and accommodations. To conclude, I met my learning goal by making meaningful design improvements and becoming more confident in applying UI/UX principles in a positive scope.</p>
															<br>
															<br>
															<b>Goal 2: Strengthen My Technical Knowledge</b>
															<br>
															<p>	
																Throughout this co-op work term at Entact Solutions, my main focus was to strengthen my technical knowledge, particularly in troubleshooting and web development. I encountered several issues while working with design tools like Figma and was able to independently resolve a few of them by researching online and experimenting with solutions. This allowed me to gain confidence and to make decisions on my own. I also engaged in discussions with team members to better understand how front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript support designs. These conversations helped me see the connections between design and development, allowing me to contribute ideas that were both visually appealing and technically feasible.This goal helped me develop a stronger technical foundation in the world of design, which I know will benefit me in future roles that I become apart of. </p>
															<br>
															<br>
															<b>Goal 3: Develop Better Project Management Abilities</b>
															<br>
															<p>	
																Improving my project management skills was an important part of working at Entact Solutions, and made tons of progress when it comes to imporving them. I started using Trello to organize tasks, track deadlines, and set weekly goals. This structure helped me stay on top of multiple design projects, especially during busy periods at Entact Solutions. By prioritizing urgency and project impact, I was able to complete assignments on time with minor last-minute adjustments. Regular check-ins with my supervisor helped ensure alignment, and I adjusted my timelines based on the requests from the team and my supervisor. I received positive feedback on my ability to deal with multiple responsibilities all while staying organized. These experiences have significantly improved my confidence in time management and project planning all while adapting to different paces faced in a work place.</p>
															<br>
															<br>
															<b>Goal 4: Improve My Communication & Documentation Skills</b>
															<br>
															<p>	
																Working at Entact Solutions helped me grow in terms of written communication and technical documentation. I was responsible for creating training materials and user guides for the HOS application, which pushed me to explain technical concepts in a clear and user-friendly manner. This allowed me to view the HOS application not only as a designer but also in the scope of individuals new to technology. I focused on writing concise and visually structured documents, including step-by-step instructions associated to visual screenshots. I shared drafts with my supervisor and team in order to receive helpful suggestions, which allowed me to improve the clarity of the instructions. This goal taught me how to tailor written content for different audiences, a skill that I feel is crucial in the field of Computer Science.</p>
