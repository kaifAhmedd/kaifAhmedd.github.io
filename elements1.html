														<h3 class="major">My Roles/Tasks at Atkins Realis(Candu Energy)</h3>
														<p>As a <b>Student Engineering Project Coordinator</b> at AtkinsRéalis, my day-to-day tasks involved collaborating 
                                                            with the project management and engineering drafting teams to create, improve, and troubleshoot reactor drawings. 
                                                            This work helped ensure engineers remained safe during reactor refurbishments and allowed them to focus on specific 
                                                            areas of the reactors while also providing feedback on potential issues. Additionally, I formatted and created new 
                                                            revisions of documents, making sure that updates and problems found in older versions were incorporated into the latest
                                                             revisions. I also worked with many Excel sheets related to hundreds of nuclear reactor drawings. In these sheets, I was 
                                                             responsible for adding details to drawings to make formatting easier, based on information requested by either the drafting or 
                                                             engineering teams. I also highlighted drawings and provided reasoning for issues that required feedback or fixes from engineers, 
                                                            ensuring we prioritized those drawings so they could be sent back to the site in a timely manner.
                                                            I also created and attended numerous scheduled meetings with 
                                                            the project management and drafting teams regarding upcoming deadlines and areas of focus for the following weeks. 
                                                            These meetings helped ensure alignment between the engineering drafting team and project management team. 
                                                            I have also worked on other tasks, but due to the confidentiality of AtkinsRealis and its clients, I cannot provide details. 
                                                            Regular feedback from my supervisor, Andrej, and the rest of my team has allowed me to improve my document formatting and troubleshooting 
                                                            skills while staying on track with project goals and deadlines. During my first four months at AtkinsRealis, I have gained many new skills 
                                                            and techniques to add to my technical portfolio, and I look forward to learning even more throughout the remainder of my co-op work term.

														<h3 class="major">Goals</h3>
														<p>
															<b>Goal 1: Improve proficiency in document and data management systems</b>
															<p>So far into my Co-op Workterm at Atkins Realis, I have made tremendous progress in learning and improving my skills with documentation and data management systems such as MyTrak. I have become much more confident in uploading, reviewing, and releasing documents with minimal to no errors, and now I pay attention to the consistency across revisions. Additionally, by asking questions and seeking clarification from my manager, Andrej, I have been able to adapt to document standards and protocols quickly. I can now independently manage the document uploads and releases with fewer corrections needed, which shows me that my technical skills and attention to detail are improving. I have received outstanding feedback from my manager, Andrej, on the final work term evaluation, which shows me that I am meeting this goal. </p>
															<br>
															<br>
															<b>Goal 2: Enhance project coordination and communication skills</b>
															<br>
															<p>	
																My communication and coordination skills have also developed as I have taken a more active role in meetings and team interactions. I haven’t really been able to schedule meetings, but as my team and I are entering the final phases of the project, I am working on it, and I will have lots of opportunities to schedule meetings between the drafters and engineers. Additionally, by asking clarifying questions and raising issues as soon as they come up, I have been able to meet task deadlines more effectively while also keeping my managers and team members informed. This approach has improved my confidence in oral communication and has helped me build stronger working relationships with both the project management and drafting teams.
															</p>
															<br>
															<br>
															<b>Goal 3: Improve time management and multitasking in a fast-paced situation</b>
															<br>
															<p>	
																Time management has been one of the most important areas of growth for me during this work term. I have learned how to balance multiple tasks, such as revising documents, updating Excel sheets, and preparing for meetings, by prioritizing deadlines that come first as well as the severity of the task at hand. It was a bit difficult to manage tasks as many managers would give me tasks unaware that I was already working on different tasks, but I have used to-do lists and calendars to stay on top of deadlines and tasks. I have also learned to communicate with my manager when my workload is heavy. This has allowed me to focus mainly on important tasks that affect the project as a whole over minor tasks. These strategies have made me more independent, reliable, and adaptable in handling responsibilities in a fast-paced environment at Atkins Realis.

														<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
														<p>
                                                        Overall, so far AtkinsRealis has been a valuable learning experience that has helped me grow significantly
                                                        both technically and professionally. I have gained tons of hands-on experience with various softwares that AtkinsRealis uses, 
                                                        document management, reactor drawings, and project coordination all while developing stronger organizational and communication skills. The 
                                                         opportunity to work closely with the project management and drafting teams has given me a better understanding 
                                                         of how large-scale nuclear projects are executed and the importance of accuracy, collaboration, and time management.
                                                          I am grateful for the support and guidance I have received from my supervisor and team, and I look forward to learning even greater things while wroking at this company as well as 
                                                          applying what I have learned in future academic and professional opportunities.
